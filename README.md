The accompanying code will reproduce figures in Brantley, et al. 2025. Datasets used to make figures are provided in the Datasets Folder. Appropriate paths must be specified to call data files within the code. All nuclear segmentation data was obtained using Cell Profiler and datasets represent Cell Profiler output that was then stacked and tracked using custom matlab code (provided). Raw data available is available at this Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/u1cxsevony76hz2p631v4/APxPRMtWb27MwPEvvA2NQR8?rlkey=kx40h5ww8lr7ul3h5s3067w5f&st=69oca2iv&dl=0.
